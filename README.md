# OPUS - An elegant book-tracker app ðŸ“–
Created by Kewbish, development beginning February 2020.  
Made with [Kivy](https://kivy.org) and Python.  
I'll be writting snippets near the bottom of whatever [blog post](https://kewbish.github.io/blog) is most current, and mirror them here, with the date. Check back for regular updates - perhaps every major commit or so.
## Currently - Designing Infrastructure
Right now, I'm working on the research component of the app. I'm looking into iOS (I'll be using it with my iPhone - yes, I know Android is superior) and its intents for sharing the tracker .json I'll be using to track the books.  
As well, I'm continuing to learn the basics of Kivy, and how its design language works. I wish I could do this with HTML + CSS, but I'll save that for a JS-based app another time. Porting my design system over to the app is more difficult than it looks!
